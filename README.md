### My Personal Website

This is the repository for the codebase of my personal website

### Tech Stack

The frontend is in React.js while the backend, used to hold my modules
taken at University, is in Node.js using Firebase Functions and can be found [https://github.com/enricozammitlon/modules-api](here). The chatbot handler repository can be found [https://github.com/enricozammitlon/personal-chatbot](here).

### Note about /files

This folder contains data I have scraped about the modules I have taken. This is
here just because I have not had the time to put in Firebase for my API to ingest yet
but hope to be able to do it soon. This is just to make clear that the frontend is not making
use of that folder.
