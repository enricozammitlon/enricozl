AIMS:On completion of the course, successful students should be able to:
1.
Use Dirac notation to represent quantum-mechanical states and manipulate operators in terms
of their matrix elements
2.
Understand the mathematical underpinnings of quantum mechanics and solve a variety of
problems with model and more realistic Hamiltonians
3.
Demonstrate familiarity with angular momentum in quantum mechanics at both a qualitative
and quantitative level
4. Use perturbation theory and other methods to find approximate solutions to problems in
quantum mechanics, including the fine-structure of energy levels of hydrogen
