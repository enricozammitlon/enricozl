AIMS:
On completion successful students will be able to:
1. understand the principles of the quark model.
2. understand all interactions in terms of a common framework of exchange quanta.
3. represent interactions and decays in terms of Feynman diagrams.
4. apply relativistic kinematics to reaction and decay processes.
5. appreciate the likely direction of new research over the next 10 years.
