AIMS:On completion successful students will be able to:
1. know Newton's theory of gravitation and to apply it to problems of planetary motion and space travel.
2. use inertial forces to explain motion from the viewpoint of rotating frames of reference.
3. know the general relation between the angular velocity and angular momentum of a rigid body, and to
solve problems in rotational dynamics.
4.
solve problems in relativistic dynamics using energy-momentum four vectors.
