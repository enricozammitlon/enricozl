AIMS:The course introduces the study of Artificial Intelligence (AI) for students in all course streams. It is designed to stand alone as an introduction to AI, but also to provide a background for more advanced study. The course presents AI from a probabilistic viewpoint, and is centred around two specific problems: (i) robot localization; (ii) speech understanding. 
The lectures will present the main theoretical ideas needed to tackle these problems; the examples classes will re-inforce these through paper-and-pencil exercises, and the labs will involve the development of programs to solve them. There will be one hour of lectures and one hour of examples classes each week, as well as five two-hour lab sessions over the semester.
