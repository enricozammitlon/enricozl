AIMS:On completion successful students will be able to:
1. Describe techniques for finding appropriate averages to predict macroscopic behaviour;
2. Apply these techniques to the calculation of the properties of matter;
3. Describe and explain the first and second laws of thermodynamics, and the concept of entropy;
4. Define and derive the fundamental thermodynamic relation;
5. Use the formalism of thermodynamics and apply it to simple systems in thermal equilibrium.
