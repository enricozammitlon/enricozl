AIMS:On completion successful students will be able to:
1. outline the basic constituents of matter and the fundamental forces between them.
2. represent elementary processes by simple Feynman diagrams.
3. use symmetries and conservation laws to identify the forces responsible for particular
reactions and decays.
4. use the quark model to explain the patterns of light hadrons.
5. use simple models to explain the patterns of nuclear masses, sizes and decays.
6. apply the independent-particle model to simple ground-state properties of nuclei.
