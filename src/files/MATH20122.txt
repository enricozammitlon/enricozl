AIMS:
On completion of this unit successful students will be able to:  

    Define several standard examples of metric spaces and prove simple results related to them.
    Determine whether a given metric space has any of the following properties: openness, closedness, completeness, compactness, path connectedness.
    Prove simple results related to all of the above notions, as well as that of continuity.
    State and prove the contraction mapping theorem along with some of its applications.

TXTBOOKS:Two books are particularly relevant. The first is Wilson A. Sutherland, Introduction to Metric and Topological Spaces, Oxford University Press (Second Edition) 2009
which contains almost all the material in the course, is beautifully written, and is highly recommended. Copies are available to purchase in Blackwells, and to borrow from the JRUL. For an alternative view, try Micheal O'Searcoid, Metric Spaces, Springer 2006.
