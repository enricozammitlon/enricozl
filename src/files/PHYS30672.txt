AIMS:On completion successful students will be able to:
1. describe the basic properties of the eigenfunctions of Sturm-Liouville operators.
2. derive the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of S-L operators in particular cases.
3. recognize when a Green's function solution is appropriate and construct the Green's function for some well known physical equations.
4. recognize and solve particular cases of Fredholm and Volterra integral equations.
5. solve a variational problem by constructing an appropriate functional, and solving the Euler-Lagrange equations.
6. solve problems related to the course material with the help of Mathematica.
