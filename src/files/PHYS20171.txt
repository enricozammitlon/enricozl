AIMS:On completion successful students will be able to:
1. Solve partial differential equations using the method of separation of variables.
2. Define the term “orthogonality” as applied to functions, and recognise sets of orthogonal functions which
are important in physics (e.g. trigonometric functions and complex exponentials on appropriate intervals,
Legendre polynomials, and spherical harmonics).
3.
Represent a given function as a linear superposition of orthogonal basis functions (e.g. a Fourier series)
using orthogonality to determine the coefficients.
4.
State how a Fourier transform differs from a Fourier series, and calculate Fourier transforms of simple
functions.
5.
Solve eigenvalue problems (differential equations subject to boundary conditions) either in terms of
standard functions or as power series.
6.
Use partial differential equations to model wave, heat flow and related phenomena.
477.
Make basic use of Dirac notation.
