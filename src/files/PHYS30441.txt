AIMS:On completion successful students will be able to:
1.
demonstrate an understanding of the use of scalar and vector potentials and of gauge
invariance.
2. demonstrate the compatibility of electrodynamics and special relativity.
3. know and use methods of solution of Poisson's equation and the inhomogeneous wave
equation.
4. know and use principles of Lorentz covariant formalism and tensor analysis.
5. distinguish between radiation fields and other electromagnetic fields.
6.Calculate the radiated power produced by accelerating charges.
