AIMS:On completion, successful students will be able to:
1. Describe how wave motion in periodic structures leads to an understanding of the temperature
dependence of specific heat, and calculate the phonon dispersion relation for a chain of atoms;
2. Explain how electron wave functions and energies are changed by the presence of the periodic crystal
potential;
3. Demonstrate how the electrical properties of metals, insulators and semiconductors are related to their
electronic structure;
4. Explain how simple semiconductor devices (such as the p-n junction) work.
