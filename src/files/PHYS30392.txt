AIMS:On completion of the course, students should be able to:
1.Explain the concepts of the expansion and curvature of space.
90 
2.Summarize the main evidence in favour of the Big Bang, inflation, dark matter and dark energy.
3.Relate  the  density  of  the  universe  to  its  rate  of  expansion  and  understand  how  this  relation  is  
modified by a cosmological constant.
4.Solve for the scale factor a(t) in different epochs of the Universe’s history.
5.Make quantative calculations of physical processes in the early universe.
6.Relate  observed  to  physical  properties  of  distant  objects  given  the  luminosity  and  angular  size  
distances.
7.Describe  the  main  events  of  the  universe's  history  and  locate  them  approximately  in  time  and  
redshift.
