AIMS:On completion successful students will:
1. have an understanding of complex variable theory;
2. know how to evaluate integrals using the residue theorem, and understand how this can also be
used to evaluate certain integrals along the real axis;
3.
understand the basic concepts of vector spaces and the relation between vectors and operators
and their representations in a given basis;
4.
be able to carry out substantial calculations involving the topics in the syllabus and recognise
the techniques necessary.
