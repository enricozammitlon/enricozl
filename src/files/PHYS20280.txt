AIMS:Student performance on each experiment is assessed by the demonstrator/supervisor during the course of the
experiment and by a final interview. Assessment takes into account: physics understanding, experimental skill
and results, quality of data analysis, error analysis and final results, innovation, commitment, planning and
quality of notes in Laboratory Notebook. For some of the experiments the interview includes a short oral
presentation.
The relative weights are: each 2-day experiment (20), each 3-day experiment (30), each 4-day experiment (40),
Laboratory reports (20, 20, 30, 30).
