AIMS:On completion successful students will be able to:
1. identify lattice and basis for simple crystal structures and construct the reciprocal lattices.
2. demonstrate an understanding of the Fermi surface and how it is modified by the presence of a weak crystal potential.
3. demonstrate an understanding of the semiclassical dynamics of electrons in solids.
4. describe and make use of the relationship between bonding and electronic structure of semiconductors, metals and metal alloys.
5. describe the microscopic origins of the magnetic properties of solids and explain some ground-state and finite-temperature properties of ferromagnets.
6. demonstrate an understanding of low dimensional system, e.g., graphene.
